      <p className="p-body">
        I began my academic journey in 2016 with a deep-seated passion for 
        graphic design, drawn by the allure of visual creativity and artistic
        expression. However, my interests evolved as I discovered the intricate
        and logical world of computer science. This shift allowed me to blend
        my artistic skills with technical prowess, enabling me to design and 
        develop websites that are not only aesthetically pleasing but also 
        highly functional.

      <p className="p-body">
        Combining these disciplines, I have honed my abilities to think 
        creatively while solving practical problems, making each project I
        undertake both a technical challenge and a creative endeavor. This
        unique skill set empowers me to deliver digital experiences that 
        captivate and engage users, ensuring both usability and visual impact.

        Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying active and embracing
        the great outdoors. Whether I am working out at the gym, hiking
        through natureâ€™s trails, or unwinding with video games, these hobbies
        help me maintain a balanced lifestyle. They not only keep me physically
        fit but also provide me with fresh inspiration and a clear mind,
        enhancing my work in computer science and web development.
